# MATLAB Scripts used in Signal Processing Subject
This repository contains MATLAB scripts developed for the purpose of completing assignments and projects for signal processing coursework at university. 
The scripts included in this repository showcase some of the basic concepts and techniques used in digital signal processing.
- Subject: Introducción al Procesamiento de Señales.
- University: Universidad Nacional de La Plata.
## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download MATLAB from the [MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

Once you have MATLAB installed, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/signal-processing-scripts.git
```

## Summary

In this subject we were asked to make informs about processing signals in different contexts such as cardio-signals processing or audio filtering.

## Important!
In Laboratorio 1 my classmate Azul Martini (Computer Engineering Student) worked in the project too.
